# LeetCodeSolutions

This project will have key problems for important sections of coding problems found in LeetCode. They will be divided by category and will showcase how you can you different algorithms and data structures to solve problems efficiency. Some problems will be in multiple categories as they can be solved in different ways and the solutions for those will be different based on what category it is in. (Example: Counting the number of islands on a grid where 1 is land and 0 is water could be done both in depth first search or breadth  first search). 

Will update this with the full list of categories and problems solved in them as I upload them to Git.
